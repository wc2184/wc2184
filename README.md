<!-- - Not seeking job.
- 👀 My all time favorite language is JavaScript, and my favorite library/framework is React. 
- 🎖️ My main focus is frontend programming. 
- 🦢 I love aesthetic websites- I enjoy getting into the nitty gritty details of website design.
- 🥪 I also do backend programming with Node/Express, Firebase, and others... but I am most proficient in React. 

 ⏱️ Recently worked on: 
- 🔨 https://www.WorkOrPay.com (Mostly to learn how to build a full stack website)

  WorkOrPay lets you be held accountable to your goals by putting down money. Set goals. Form contracts. Pay the penalty if you fail. Accountability with dollars on the line. -->
